# Password Generator

## Proposal
To generate, store, and load unique passwords given the user's preferences, including character types to include and the number of passwords to be generated.

The focus group for this application includes any individual who wishes to bypass the process of thinking of a new password, which may be similar to an existing password used, by having the application generate one.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to generate at least one password given a preferred password length and certain character type preferences (i.e., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
- As a user, I want to ensure that at least one character type selected is included in the generated password.
- As a user, I want to ensure that there are no duplicate passwords.
- **TODO: As a user, I want to be able to save and load a list of passwords.**
- **TODO: As a user, I want to be able to add or remove a password in a list.**
- **TODO: As a user, I want to be able to use the application through a UI.**
